(Minecraft 1.18.2 must be installed)
First, click the green button that says "code", then download the files as a .zip. Unzip them and run "install.bat" (just double click).
You will be prompted with a screen to install fabric. Leave all the options as default but check "install as fabric mod". Then let it finish
and close the window. Then just boot up minecraft with the "fabric" version and have fun!
