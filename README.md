# Minecraft-Mods-and-Shaders

(Minecraft 1.19 must be installed)
You will also need forge for 1.19 installed (can be found here: https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.19.html)
Then just grab the .jar files from the .zip you downloaded and copy them to your mods folder (you will need start minecraft with forge for this to appear.)
On windows hit WIN + R and type in %appdata%\.minecraft\mods
If you're on linux you probably already know how to do this, but it's in ~/.minecraft/mods
And if you're on mac, I'm sorry, you'll just have to google it (I don't own a mac)

For shaders, I would recomment sildurs shaders.
